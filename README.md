# INVOICE_GENERATOR_C++
Overview
The Invoice Management System is a comprehensive C++ application designed to facilitate the generation and management of invoices for small to medium-sized businesses. This project demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming, data management, and software design principles, while providing a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing, and modifying invoices.

Key Features
Dynamic Item Management: Users can add, delete, and modify items in each invoice. Each item includes detailed information such as name, category, quantity, and price, allowing for flexible invoice customization.

Multiple Invoice Templates: The system supports two distinct invoice templates:

Simple Template: Presents a concise overview of the invoice items and totals.
Detailed Template: Offers a comprehensive breakdown, including item categories and individual prices, enhancing clarity for the customer.
Discount and Tax Calculations: Users can apply discounts and taxes to the total invoice amount, with calculations dynamically updated to reflect changes.

Unique Invoice Generation: Each invoice is assigned a unique number based on the current date and a counter, ensuring easy tracking and organization.

Comprehensive Invoice Viewing: The system allows users to view all generated invoices, displaying complete details including items, totals, and customer information, facilitating easy record-keeping and retrieval.

User-Friendly Interface: The command-line interface guides users through the invoice creation process with prompts and instructions, ensuring an intuitive experience.

Technical Skills Demonstrated
Object-Oriented Programming: The application leverages classes and inheritance to structure the codebase, promoting reusability and maintainability.

Data Structures: Utilizes vectors for dynamic storage of invoice items and invoices, showcasing an understanding of efficient data management.

Time Handling: Incorporates date and time functionalities for generating timestamps and unique invoice numbers.

Formatted Output: Implements formatting techniques for displaying invoice details clearly and professionally, enhancing user experience.

How to Use
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the executable and follow the prompts to create and manage invoices.
Future Enhancements
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more modern user experience.
Add database integration for persistent storage of invoices.
Introduce export functionalities to save invoices in various formats (e.g., PDF).
